    "This script should fit a polynomial to electricity usage data. But, there is an error indicating that the first two inputs to polyfit should be the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can inspect the variables elapsedYears and usage to know they are not the same size. usage should be a vector, not a matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable usage keeps changing! So where did the mistake occur? \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see where the error seems to be introduced by removing semicolons (line 8). It would be helpful to pause the code right before this line so we can test modifications using the value at that point in the script. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bild 7 gibt eine Übersicht über das Skript, um das es geht.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn to step through your code and pause execution before certain lines. Not only does this allow you to see how variables change with each modification, but also you can troubleshoot and test possible solutions using the intermediate variable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One way that you may already be familiar with is to leverage sections. You can add section breaks and run the script section-by-section with Run and Advance in the Live Editor tab in the toolstrip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between code sections, you can try things out at the command prompt. If adding sections breaks up your code organization, you may need to remove unneeded section breaks later. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to step through code is to use built-in debugging tools. To pause code execution before a line, you can set breakpoints by clicking the line number. These are indicated with a red box. Here, we added breakpoints before each line that modifies usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you click run, MATLAB will pause before executing lines 3, 8, 9, and 11, allowing you to inspect variables and try things out before continuing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click, Run, the first two lines are executed. Line 3, highlighted in green, has not been run. So, usage has not been created yet. To continue to the next breakpoint, click Continue in the Live Editor tab in the toolstrip. This executes every line before the next breakpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    " When your code execution is paused, you can inspect variables in the workspace or by mousing over just like you did before. usage is the right size before it is modified in line 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to inspecting other variables, you can try things out at the command prompt. The command prompt is marked with a \"K\" to indicate you are in debug mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common strategy to test the line you are about to run and try other solutions. It looks like the current line changes the size of usage. The normalization should have been element-wise for usage to remain a vector. You can fix that by changing / to ./. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to step through your code one line at a time instead of continuing to the next breakpoint, you can use the Step button in the Live Editor tab in the toolstrip. For instance, clicking Step twice will get you to the start of line 10, even though there is no breakpoint there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The breakpoints have changed to gray to indicate there was a change in the code that may not be reflected as you step through. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are finished making changes, save your work. This exits debug mode. Then right-click the side bar to clear the breakpooints.\n",
    "\n",
    "To exit debug mode without saving your work, click the Stop button in the Live Editor tab in the toolstrip. "
